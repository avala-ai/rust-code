## Install

**One-line install** (Linux/macOS):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/avala-ai/agent-code/main/install.sh | bash
```

Or via package managers:

```bash
# crates.io
cargo install agent-code

# homebrew
brew install avala-ai/tap/agent-code
```


## Set your API key

agent-code works with any LLM provider. Set the key for the one you use:


```bash
# Anthropic (Claude)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."

# OpenAI (GPT)
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."

# xAI (Grok)
export XAI_API_KEY="xai-..."

# Any provider
export AGENT_CODE_API_KEY="your-key"
export AGENT_CODE_API_BASE_URL="https://api.your-provider.com/v1"
```


## Start the agent

```bash
rc
```

You'll see:

```
 agent  session a1b2c3d
Type your message, or /help for commands. Ctrl+C to cancel, Ctrl+D to exit.

>
```

## Try it out

Type a natural language request:

```
> what files are in this project?
```

The agent will use the `Glob` and `FileRead` tools to explore and answer.

Try something more complex:

```
> add a health check endpoint to the API server that returns the git commit hash
```

The agent will:
1. Read the existing code to understand the project structure
2. Find how other endpoints are defined
3. Write the new endpoint
4. Run tests if they exist

## Slash commands

Type `/help` to see all available commands:

```
> /help

Available commands:

  /help           Show this help message
  /clear          Clear conversation history
  /cost           Show session cost and token usage
  /model          Show or change the current model
  /commit         Commit current changes
  /review         Review current diff for issues
  /plan           Toggle plan mode (read-only)
  /doctor         Check environment health
  ...
```

## One-shot mode

For scripting and CI, use `--prompt` to run a single task and exit:

```bash
agent --prompt "fix the failing tests" --dangerously-skip-permissions
```
