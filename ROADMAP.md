---

## Phase 4: Provider Expansion

**Priority: Medium** | **Target: v0.12**

### 4.1 New Providers — Done (4/5)

- [x] **Azure OpenAI** — separate from generic OpenAI, with Azure-specific auth (AD tokens, managed identity, `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`)
- [x] **OpenRouter** — single API key for any model (`OPENROUTER_API_KEY`)
- [x] **Cohere** — Command R+ models
- [x] **Perplexity** — search-augmented generation
- [ ] **GitHub Copilot** — Copilot token-based access for GitHub users

### 4.2 Provider Features

- [ ] Interactive setup wizard for Bedrock (AWS credential chain, region, model selection)
- [ ] Provider health check in `/doctor` output

### 4.3 Model Routing and Automatic Fallback

Automatically detect model unavailability and route to alternatives without user intervention.

**Availability State Machine:**

Each model tracks health via a 3-state machine:
- `healthy` — model is available, use normally
- `sticky_retry` — transient error occurred; allow one retry per turn, then skip
- `terminal` — permanent unavailability (quota exhausted, model deprecated, capacity limit)

State transitions:
```text
healthy ──[transient error]──▶ sticky_retry ──[consumed]──▶ skip this turn
healthy ──[permanent error]──▶ terminal ──[never recovers within session]
sticky_retry ──[turn boundary]──▶ healthy (reset for next turn)
```

**Composite Routing Strategy:**

Evaluate strategies in priority order; first match wins:
1. **OverrideStrategy** — honor user `/model` override regardless of routing (always wins)
2. **FallbackStrategy** — check availability state; if unhealthy, select next model in chain
3. **CostStrategy** — route to cheaper model when task is simple (e.g., file listing vs. architecture refactor)
4. **DefaultStrategy** — use configured model

**Fallback Chain Configuration:**

```toml
[routing]
fallback_chain = ["primary-model", "secondary-model", "tertiary-model"]
cost_threshold_usd = 0.50  # Switch to cheaper model after this session cost

[routing.availability]
retry_on_transient = true
terminal_on_quota = true
```

**Cross-feature interaction:** Model switches invalidate prompt cache (see 7.13). Every provider's cache is model-specific. The routing service should notify the cache strategy when a fallback triggers, so the cache layer can log the cost impact and pre-warm the new model's cache.

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] Add `ModelAvailabilityService` to `crates/lib/src/services/` with health state tracking per model
- [ ] Add `ModelRouterService` to `crates/lib/src/services/` with ordered strategy evaluation
- [ ] Add `fallback_chain` and `routing` sections to `ConfigSchema`
- [ ] Wire router into `query/mod.rs` loop — on LLM error, consult router before retrying
- [ ] Add `resetTurn()` call at turn boundary to clear sticky consumption flags
- [ ] Log routing decisions with reason (e.g., "Model X unavailable (quota). Falling back to Y")
- [ ] Notify cache strategy on model switch (see 7.13) to track cache invalidation cost
- [ ] Add `/routing` slash command showing current model health states
- [ ] Tests: unit tests for state machine transitions, integration tests for chain traversal

- [x] Lesson structure: explanation, try-it prompt, success verification
- [x] Ship 5 lessons covering core features

### 7.4 Process-Level Sandboxing

**Priority: Critical** | **Target: v1.1**

The current permission system is policy enforcement within the same process — it trusts that tools respect the rules. A malicious tool result or prompt injection could bypass permission checks because no OS-level boundary exists. Process-level sandboxing ensures that even if the agent is compromised, damage is contained.

**Architecture:**

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  Agent Process (unsandboxed)    │
│  ├─ REPL, config, LLM client   │
│  └─ Tool Dispatch               │
│       │                          │
│       ▼                          │
│  ┌────────────────────────┐     │

│  │  ├─ macOS: seatbelt    │     │
│  │  ├─ Linux: bubblewrap  │     │
│  │  └─ Windows: integrity │     │
│  └────────────────────────┘     │
│       │                          │
│       ▼                          │
│  ┌────────────────────────┐     │
│  │  Sandboxed subprocess  │     │
│  │  - No network (opt)    │     │
│  │  - Write-scoped to cwd │     │
│  │  - Secret files masked │     │
│  └────────────────────────┘     │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**macOS Seatbelt Strategy:**

Use `sandbox-exec` with an SBPL (Scheme) policy:
- Start from `(deny default)` — block all operations
- Selectively allow: file reads everywhere, file writes only within project directory and allowed paths
- Network access conditionally appended (enabled for `WebFetch`, disabled for `Bash`)
- Secret file masking: regex patterns to block `.env`, `.env.*`, credential files
- Git worktree support: auto-detect `.git` directory and grant read/write to the underlying git directory for both worktrees and main repos
- Dual-path resolution: resolve both symbolic and real paths to prevent symlink bypass attacks

```text
(version 1)
(deny default)
(import "system.sb")
(allow file-read* (subpath "/"))
(allow file-write* (subpath "${PROJECT_DIR}"))
(deny file-read* (regex #"^.*/\.env(\..+)?$"))
```

**Linux bubblewrap (bwrap) Strategy:**

Use namespace isolation via `bwrap`:
- `--unshare-all` — isolate user, IPC, UTS, mount, PID, and network namespaces
- `--dev /dev` — minimal device stubs instead of host /dev
- `--proc /proc` — isolated process info
- Secret masking: find `.env*` files (maxdepth 3 for performance) and bind to `/dev/null`
- Forbidden path handling: `--tmpfs` + `--remount-ro` for directories, `/dev/null` binding for files
- Network: conditionally add `--share-net` for tools that need it

**Windows Low Integrity Strategy:**

Use Windows Mandatory Integrity Control:
- Spawn sandboxed process with Low Mandatory Level (SID `S-1-16-4096`)
- Grant Modify access (`(OI)(CI)(M)`) to Low integrity SID on project directory via `icacls`
- Deny Low Integrity access (`(OI)(CI)(F)`) to secret files
- Reject UNC paths (`\\server\share`) to prevent credential theft via SMB
- Never modify ACLs on `%SystemRoot%`, `%ProgramFiles%` — prevent host corruption
- Use manifest file for forbidden paths to avoid command-line length limits

**Policy Configuration (TOML):**

```toml
[sandbox]
enabled = true
strategy = "auto"  # auto-detect platform, or: "seatbelt", "bwrap", "none"

# Paths the sandbox can write to (beyond project directory)
allowed_write_paths = ["/tmp", "~/.cache/agent-code"]

# Paths the sandbox can never read
forbidden_paths = ["~/.ssh", "~/.aws/credentials", "~/.gnupg"]

# Secret file patterns to mask (bound to /dev/null)
secret_patterns = [".env", ".env.*", "credentials.json", "*.pem"]

# Per-tool sandbox overrides
[sandbox.tools]
Bash = { network = false }     # No network for shell commands
WebFetch = { network = true }  # Network required
FileRead = { sandbox = false } # Skip sandbox for reads (performance)
```

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] Add `crates/lib/src/sandbox/mod.rs` — trait `SandboxStrategy` with `fn wrap_command(&self, cmd: Command, policy: &SandboxPolicy) -> Command`
- [ ] Add `crates/lib/src/sandbox/seatbelt.rs` — macOS implementation using `sandbox-exec -f <profile>`
- [ ] Add `crates/lib/src/sandbox/bwrap.rs` — Linux implementation using `bwrap` binary
- [ ] Add `crates/lib/src/sandbox/windows.rs` — Windows Low Integrity via `icacls` + restricted token
- [ ] Add `crates/lib/src/sandbox/policy.rs` — `SandboxPolicy` struct parsed from config TOML
- [ ] Add `SandboxConfig` section to `ConfigSchema` with `enabled`, `strategy`, `allowed_write_paths`, `forbidden_paths`, `secret_patterns`
- [ ] Wire into process-creation sites: `bash.rs` (Command::new), `agent.rs` (build_agent_command), `powershell.rs` — NOT executor.rs (which calls trait methods, not subprocesses)
- [ ] Create `SandboxedCommand` wrapper that intercepts `std::process::Command` construction and prepends sandbox args (bwrap/sandbox-exec)
- [ ] Per-tool override: `sandbox.tools.<ToolName>` config for network/sandbox toggles
- [ ] Auto-detect platform and select strategy in `SandboxStrategy::detect()`
- [ ] Secret masking: scan project + allowed paths for files matching `secret_patterns`, mask them
- [ ] Git worktree detection: resolve `.git` files to actual git directories, add to allowed paths
- [ ] Symlink resolution: resolve both canonical and symlink paths to prevent bypass
- [ ] Fallback behavior: if sandbox binary not found (`bwrap` / `sandbox-exec`), warn and run unsandboxed with degraded security notice
- [ ] `/sandbox` slash command showing current strategy, allowed paths, masked files
- [ ] Add `--no-sandbox` CLI flag to disable (requires `disable_bypass_permissions = false`)
- [ ] Tests: unit tests for policy parsing, integration tests for each platform strategy
- [ ] Benchmark: measure sandbox overhead per tool call (target: <10ms)

**Future: gVisor (runsc) for Linux**

bubblewrap provides namespace isolation (process, mount, network) but does NOT filter syscalls. A compromised process inside bwrap can still make arbitrary syscalls. gVisor intercepts all syscalls in userspace via its Go-based kernel, providing the strongest isolation available on Linux. Deferred because it requires Docker runtime (`--runtime=runsc`), adding a heavy dependency. Ship bwrap first, add gVisor as an optional upgrade for high-security environments.

### 7.5 Behavioral Evaluation Framework

**Priority: High** | **Target: v1.1**

Unit and integration tests verify that code compiles and functions run correctly. Behavioral evals verify that the agent actually accomplishes tasks when given a prompt and a live LLM. This is a fundamentally different category of testing — it answers "does the agent work?" rather than "does the code compile?"

**Architecture:**

```text
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Eval Harness (eval_runner binary)               │
│  ├─ Load eval definitions from evals/            │
│  ├─ For each eval:                               │
│  │   ├─ Set up temp workspace (fixture files)    │
│  │   ├─ Run agent with prompt + auto-approve     │
│  │   ├─ Capture: tool calls, files changed, exit │
│  │   ├─ Run assertions                           │
│  │   └─ Retry up to N times (LLM non-determinism)│
│  └─ Report: pass/fail/flaky per eval             │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Eval Definition Format:**

```rust
// evals/file_editing.rs
eval_test! {
    name: "creates_new_file_when_asked",
    policy: EvalPolicy::AlwaysPasses,
    fixture: "evals/fixtures/empty_project/",
    prompt: "Create a file called hello.py that prints 'Hello, world!'",
    max_turns: 5,
    assert: |rig| {
        assert!(rig.workspace.join("hello.py").exists());
        let content = std::fs::read_to_string(rig.workspace.join("hello.py"))?;
        assert!(content.contains("Hello, world!"));
        assert!(rig.tool_log.contains_call("FileWrite"));
    }
}
```

**Two Policy Tiers:**

| Tier | Pass Requirement | CI Behavior | Promotion Path |
|------|------------------|-------------|----------------|
| `AlwaysPasses` | 100% (all retries) | Blocks merge | Promoted from `UsuallyPasses` after 7 days at 100% |
| `UsuallyPasses` | 50%+ (best-of-N) | Monitored nightly, does not block | New evals start here |

**Best-of-N Retry Logic:**

LLMs are non-deterministic — the same prompt may produce different tool call sequences:
- Each eval runs up to 4 times
- `AlwaysPasses`: must pass all 4
- `UsuallyPasses`: must pass 2+ of 4 (50% bar)
- On transient API errors (rate limit, timeout), retry is free (doesn't count as failure)

**Trustworthiness Filtering:**

Before including a `UsuallyPasses` eval in CI, verify stability:
- Must pass 60%+ on nightly runs (2 of 3 every night)
- Must maintain 80%+ aggregate over trailing 6 days
- Evals below threshold are excluded from CI with a `flaky` label

**Test Rig Features:**

```rust
struct TestRig {
    workspace: PathBuf,            // Temp directory with fixture files
    tool_log: ToolLog,             // Captured tool calls with arguments
    activity_log: Vec<Event>,      // Timestamped agent events (JSONL)
    session_history: Vec<Message>, // Full conversation for debugging
}

impl TestRig {
    /// Pause agent before specific tool calls (tests model steering)
    fn set_breakpoint(&mut self, tools: &[&str]);
    /// Inject a user hint between tool calls
    fn add_user_hint(&mut self, hint: &str);
    /// Read captured tool call log
    fn tool_calls(&self) -> &[CapturedToolCall];
}
```

**Breakpoint & Steering Tests:**

```rust
eval_test! {
    name: "responds_to_corrective_hint",
    policy: EvalPolicy::UsuallyPasses,
    prompt: "Refactor the User struct to use builder pattern",
    setup: |rig| {
        rig.set_breakpoint(&["FileWrite"]);
        rig.add_user_hint("Actually, use the typestate pattern instead of builder");
    },
    assert: |rig| {
        let content = std::fs::read_to_string(rig.workspace.join("src/user.rs"))?;
        assert!(content.contains("impl User<Unvalidated>"));
        assert!(!content.contains("UserBuilder"));
    }
}
```

**Nightly CI Pipeline:**

```yaml
# .github/workflows/evals-nightly.yml
schedule:
  - cron: "0 2 * * *"  # 2 AM UTC daily
jobs:
  evals:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        model: [default-model, fallback-model]
    steps:
      - run: cargo run --bin eval_runner -- --policy usually_passes --retries 3
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
```

**Automatic Promotion:**

A scheduled job reviews nightly results weekly:
- If a `UsuallyPasses` eval has passed 100% for 7+ consecutive days → auto-promote to `AlwaysPasses`
- If an `AlwaysPasses` eval fails 2+ times in a week → auto-demote to `UsuallyPasses` with alert

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] Create `evals/` directory at repo root with harness module
- [ ] Add `eval_runner` binary to `crates/cli/` (separate from main CLI binary)
- [ ] Implement `TestRig` with workspace setup, tool log capture, activity logging
- [ ] Implement `eval_test!` macro for declarative eval definitions
- [ ] Implement best-of-N retry logic with transient error detection
- [ ] Implement breakpoint mechanism: intercept tool dispatch, pause, inject hint
- [ ] Add `EvalPolicy` enum and tier enforcement
- [ ] Write 10 seed evals: file creation, file editing, grep usage, bash execution, multi-file refactor, test writing, error recovery, permission denial handling, plan mode, multi-turn conversation
- [ ] Add `evals/fixtures/` with starter project templates
- [ ] Create `.github/workflows/evals-nightly.yml` with matrix strategy
- [ ] Create `.github/workflows/evals-promotion.yml` for weekly auto-promotion
- [ ] Add trustworthiness tracking: JSONL log of pass/fail per eval per night
- [ ] Add `cargo run --bin eval_runner -- --list` to show all evals with status
- [ ] Add `cargo run --bin eval_runner -- --eval <name>` to run a single eval

### 7.6 Advanced History Compression

**Priority: High** | **Target: v1.1**

The current compaction system (auto/reactive/microcompact) is solid but operates at message granularity. File-level tracking and secret masking improve both accuracy and security.

**File-Level Compression Tracking:**

Track each file mentioned in the conversation at one of four fidelity levels:

| Level | Description | When |
|-------|-------------|------|
| `Full` | Complete file contents in context | Recently read (within last 2 turns) |
| `Partial` | Key sections only (functions referenced, changed lines) | Older reads, still relevant |
| `Summary` | LLM-generated 2-3 sentence summary of file's role | Old reads, rarely referenced |
| `Excluded` | File removed from context entirely | Stale, never referenced again |

```rust
struct FileCompressionRecord {
    path: PathBuf,
    level: CompressionLevel,
    content_hash: [u8; 12],  // 12-byte SHA256 slice for change detection
    line_range: Option<(usize, usize)>,  // For Partial level
    last_referenced_turn: usize,
}
```

**Content Hash Change Detection:**

When the agent re-reads a file:
1. Compute 12-byte SHA256 of current content
2. Compare to stored hash
3. If changed: reset to `Full` level (file was modified, agent needs fresh context)
4. If unchanged: keep current level (no new information)

This prevents re-injecting stale file content after edits, while avoiding unnecessary re-reads of unchanged files.

**Protected File Mechanism:**

Files read in the last 2 turns (4 history items) are locked at `Full` level and cannot be compressed. This prevents the compactor from summarizing files the agent is actively working on.

**Secret Masking in Compression:**

Before passing history to the LLM for summarization, redact sensitive patterns:

```rust
const SECRET_PATTERNS: &[&str] = &[
    r"(?i)(api[_-]?key|secret|password|token)\s*[:=]\s*\S+",
    r"AKIA[0-9A-Z]{16}",                    // AWS access keys
    r"sk-[a-zA-Z0-9]{20,}",                 // Provider API keys
    r"ghp_[a-zA-Z0-9]{36}",                 // GitHub PATs
    r"-----BEGIN (RSA |EC )?PRIVATE KEY-----", // PEM keys
];
```

Replace matched patterns with `[REDACTED:<type>]` before compression. The summary never contains raw secrets, even if they appeared in tool results.

**Compression State Persistence:**

Save compression records to `~/.cache/agent-code/sessions/<id>/compression_state.json` so session restoration respects file compression levels.

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] Add `FileCompressionRecord` struct to `services/compact.rs`
- [ ] Add `CompressionLevel` enum: `Full`, `Partial`, `Summary`, `Excluded`
- [ ] Implement content hashing (12-byte SHA256 slice) for change detection
- [ ] Implement protected file mechanism: lock recent 2-turn file reads
- [ ] Add `SecretMasker` module with shared regex patterns (reusable across all write boundaries)
- [ ] Apply `SecretMasker` at ALL persistence points, not just compression:
  - Before LLM summarization (compression path)
  - In `session.rs` when serializing session JSON to disk
  - In `output_store.rs` when writing large tool results to disk
  - In `/share` command when exporting transcripts
- [ ] Add compression state serialization to session persistence
- [ ] Wire into existing auto-compact: after summarization, update file records
- [ ] Add `/compression` slash command showing file compression states
- [ ] Tests: verify secrets are redacted in summaries, session files, disk outputs, and exports

### 7.7 Non-Interactive Structured Output

**Priority: Medium** | **Target: v1.1**

The current `--prompt` one-shot mode outputs plain text. For CI/CD pipelines, GitHub Actions, and tool-chaining, structured JSON streaming is essential.

**JSON Streaming Format:**

Each event is a single JSON line (JSONL) written to stdout:

```jsonl
{"type":"session_start","session_id":"abc-123","model":"your-preferred-model","timestamp":"2026-04-06T12:00:00Z"}
{"type":"text_delta","content":"I'll create the file now.","turn":1}
{"type":"tool_call","tool":"FileWrite","input":{"file_path":"hello.py","content":"print('hello')"},"turn":1}
{"type":"tool_result","tool":"FileWrite","output":"File written successfully","is_error":false,"turn":1}
{"type":"text_delta","content":"Done! I created hello.py.","turn":1}
{"type":"turn_complete","turn":1,"input_tokens":1234,"output_tokens":567,"cost_usd":0.003}
{"type":"session_end","turns":1,"total_cost_usd":0.003,"exit_code":0}
```

**Event Types:**

| Event | Fields | When |
|-------|--------|------|
| `session_start` | session_id, model, timestamp | Session begins |
| `text_delta` | content, turn | LLM streams text |
| `thinking` | content, turn | Extended thinking block |
| `tool_call` | tool, input, turn | Tool invocation starts |
| `tool_result` | tool, output, is_error, turn | Tool completes |
| `permission_request` | tool, message, turn | Permission needed (auto-denied in non-interactive) |
| `turn_complete` | turn, input_tokens, output_tokens, cost_usd | Turn finishes |
| `error` | message, code, turn | Error occurred |
| `session_end` | turns, total_cost_usd, exit_code | Session ends |

**CLI Interface:**

```bash
# JSON streaming to stdout
agent --prompt "fix the tests" --output-format json

# Pipe to jq for filtering
agent --prompt "fix the tests" --output-format json | jq 'select(.type == "tool_call")'

# Human-readable feedback on stderr, structured data on stdout
agent --prompt "review this PR" --output-format json 2>/dev/null | process_results.py
```

**Exit Codes:**

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success — agent completed normally |
| 1 | Fatal configuration error |
| 2 | Fatal input error |
| 3 | Tool execution failure (unrecoverable) |
| 4 | LLM error (all retries and fallbacks exhausted) |
| 5 | Cost limit exceeded |
| 6 | Turn limit exceeded |
| 7 | Permission denied (non-interactive, no auto-approve) |

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] Add `OutputFormat` enum (`Text`, `Json`) to CLI config
- [ ] Add `--output-format` CLI flag (default: `text`)
- [ ] Create `JsonStreamFormatter` in `crates/cli/src/output/` that writes JSONL to stdout
- [ ] Route all agent events through formatter: text deltas, tool calls, tool results, turns, errors
- [ ] Human-readable status messages go to stderr in JSON mode
- [ ] Implement exit code enumeration matching table above
- [ ] Add `--resume <session-id>` support in non-interactive mode
- [ ] Handle Ctrl+C in non-TTY mode: detect `\u0003` on stdin or SIGINT
- [ ] Add permission auto-denial in JSON mode (with `permission_request` event)
- [ ] Tests: verify JSONL output parses correctly, verify exit codes, verify stderr/stdout separation

### 7.8 Remote Agent Protocol

**Priority: Medium** | **Target: v1.2**

Current subagents run as local subprocesses. A remote agent protocol enables out-of-process agents running on other machines, in containers, or as cloud services — enabling distributed workloads, specialized agents, and team-shared agent pools.

**Protocol Design:**

Use JSON-RPC 2.0 over multiple transports:

| Transport | Use Case | Configuration |
|-----------|----------|---------------|
| Stdio | Local subprocess (current behavior) | `command`, `args` |
| HTTP/REST | Remote agents, cloud services | `url` |
| WebSocket | Long-running agents with bidirectional streaming | `url` (ws:// or wss://) |

**Agent Card (Discovery):**

Remote agents publish an Agent Card describing capabilities:

```json
{
  "name": "security-auditor",
  "description": "Specialized agent for security analysis",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "capabilities": ["file_read", "grep", "bash"],
  "max_turn_duration_secs": 1800,
  "authentication": {
    "type": "bearer_token",
    "token_env": "SECURITY_AGENT_TOKEN"
  },
  "endpoint": "https://agents.internal.company.com/security-auditor"
}
```

**Agent Card Resolution:**
- URL: fetch card from `<endpoint>/.well-known/agent-card.json`
- Inline: embed card JSON directly in config
- Local: load from `.agent-code/agents/<name>.json`

**Streaming Progress:**

Remote agents stream progress updates back to the coordinator:
- `progress` — intermediate status text
- `tool_call` — tool invocation notification (for audit logging)
- `complete` — final result with summary
- `error` — failure with error details

**Session State Persistence:**

Maintain per-remote-agent `context_id` and `task_id` across invocations so follow-up prompts continue the same conversation.

**Configuration:**

```toml
[agents.security-auditor]
type = "remote"
url = "https://agents.internal.company.com/security-auditor"
auth = { type = "bearer_token", token_env = "SECURITY_AGENT_TOKEN" }
timeout_secs = 1800  # 30 min for long-running audits

[agents.test-runner]
type = "remote"
url = "ws://localhost:9090/agent"
auth = { type = "none" }
timeout_secs = 600
```

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] Define `AgentCard` struct in `crates/lib/src/agents/`
- [ ] Add `RemoteAgentClient` with HTTP and WebSocket transports
- [ ] Add Agent Card resolution: URL fetch, inline JSON, local file
- [ ] Add authentication: bearer token, API key header, OAuth2
- [ ] Implement streaming progress reassembly (accumulate chunks into final result)
- [ ] Add session state persistence for multi-turn remote conversations
- [ ] Wire into `Coordinator` — `spawn_agent()` selects local vs remote based on config
- [ ] Add 30-minute timeout for remote agents (vs 5-minute default for local)
- [ ] Add `/agents` slash command showing local + remote agents with health status
- [ ] Add remote agent health check: periodic ping to verify endpoint is responsive
- [ ] Tests: mock HTTP/WebSocket server for remote agent protocol tests

### 7.9 DevTools Debugging Server

**Priority: Medium** | **Target: v1.2**

For developers building on top of agent-code, debugging complex sessions, or developing custom tools/skills, a dedicated debugging server provides real-time inspection without cluttering the REPL.

**Architecture:**

```text
┌─────────────────┐     WebSocket      ┌──────────────────────┐
│  Agent Process   │──────────────────▶│  DevTools UI          │
│  (with devtools  │                    │  (browser at          │
│   server enabled)│◀──────────────────│   localhost:25417)    │
└─────────────────┘     Commands       └──────────────────────┘
```

**Data Streams:**

| Stream | Buffer Size | Content |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Tool Calls | 2000 entries | Tool name, input, output, duration, error, turn |
| LLM Requests | 500 entries | Model, tokens in/out, cache hits, latency, streaming chunks |
| Permission Events | 1000 entries | Tool, decision, reason, rule matched |
| Console Logs | 5000 entries | Level, message, timestamp, source |
| Agent Events | 1000 entries | Turn start/end, compaction, model switch, session events |

All buffers are bounded FIFO — oldest entries evicted when full.

**WebSocket Protocol:**

```jsonl
// Server → Client: real-time events
{"type":"tool_call","data":{"tool":"Bash","input":{"command":"cargo test"},"turn":3},"timestamp":"..."}
{"type":"llm_request","data":{"model":"your-preferred-model","input_tokens":15234,"latency_ms":2340},"timestamp":"..."}

// Client → Server: commands
{"type":"command","action":"pause"}
{"type":"command","action":"resume"}
{"type":"command","action":"get_state"}
```

**CLI Integration:**

```bash
agent --devtools                       # Enable on default port (25417)
agent --devtools --devtools-port 9999  # Custom port
```

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] Add `crates/lib/src/services/devtools.rs` — WebSocket server using `tokio-tungstenite`
- [ ] Implement bounded event buffers for each data stream
- [ ] Add WebSocket message protocol (server→client events, client→server commands)
- [ ] Add port auto-negotiation with file-based port discovery
- [ ] Wire into tool executor, LLM client, permission checker for event emission
- [ ] Add `--devtools` and `--devtools-port` CLI flags
- [ ] Add `[devtools]` config section
- [ ] Add pause/resume commands via WebSocket
- [ ] Create minimal HTML viewer page served at `http://localhost:<port>/` (single-file, no build step)
- [ ] Tests: WebSocket connection, event emission, buffer overflow

### 7.10 GitHub Automation

**Priority: Medium** | **Target: v1.2**

Extend beyond CLI into GitHub-native workflows for community scaling and CI/CD integration.

**GitHub Action:**

A first-party GitHub Action that runs agent-code in CI:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/pr-review.yml
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]

jobs:
  review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: avala-ai/agent-code-action@v1
        with:
          prompt: "Review this PR for security issues and test coverage gaps."
          model: your-preferred-model
          max-cost-usd: 1.0
          output-format: json
        env:
          LLM_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.LLM_API_KEY }}
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

**Automated Issue Triage:**

A reusable workflow that uses agent-code to analyze new issues and apply labels:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/issue-triage.yml
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened, reopened]
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 * * * *"  # Hourly for untriaged backlog
```

Triage rules:
- Apply area labels (area/core, area/tools, area/docs, area/security, area/platform)
- Apply kind labels (kind/bug, kind/feature, kind/question, kind/docs)
- Apply priority labels (P1-P3 only — never assign P0, route to manual triage instead)
- Demote priority if issue lacks reproduction steps (P1→P2, P2→P3)
- Never remove maintainer-applied labels
- Add `status/bot-triaged` to all processed issues

**PR Auditing:**

Automated PR-to-issue linking and label synchronization:
- Link PRs to issues via commit messages and branch names
- Sync labels from linked issues to PRs
- Run on 15-minute schedule for near-real-time updates

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] Create `action/` directory with `action.yml` (GitHub Action metadata)
- [ ] Action wraps Docker image: pull `ghcr.io/avala-ai/agent-code`, run with `--prompt` + `--output-format json`
- [ ] Add `GITHUB_TOKEN` integration: agent can read PR diffs, post comments, apply labels via `gh` CLI
- [ ] Create reusable workflow templates: `pr-review.yml`, `issue-triage.yml`, `pr-audit.yml`
- [ ] Add issue triage prompt templates with label taxonomy
- [ ] Create documentation in `docs/tutorials/github-action.mdx`
- [ ] Tests: Action integration tests using `act` (local GitHub Actions runner)

### 7.11 OAuth Authentication

**Priority: Medium** | **Target: v1.2**

API key management is friction for new users. Adding OAuth-based authentication with OS keychain storage simplifies onboarding for users who already have provider accounts.

**Authentication Flow:**

```text
User runs `agent` for the first time
    │
    ▼
CLI detects no API key configured
    │
    ▼
Presents auth options:
  1. Sign in with account (OAuth — opens browser)
  2. Enter API key manually
  3. Use environment variable
    │
    ▼ (Option 1)
Opens browser to auth endpoint
    │
    ▼
User authenticates → redirect to localhost callback
    │
    ▼
CLI receives OAuth token, stores in OS keychain
    │
    ▼
Token used for API requests (auto-refresh on expiry)
```

**Token Storage:**

| Platform | Storage |
|----------|---------|
| macOS | Keychain Services (`security` CLI) |
| Linux | `libsecret` / `gnome-keyring` / `kwallet` (fallback: encrypted file) |
| Windows | Windows Credential Manager (`cmdkey`) |

Never store tokens in plaintext config files.

**Token Lifecycle:**

- Access tokens: 1-hour TTL, auto-refresh on 401 response
- Refresh tokens: stored in keychain alongside access token
- If refresh fails: prompt re-authentication via browser

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] Add `crates/lib/src/auth/` module with `AuthProvider` trait
- [ ] Implement `OAuthProvider` with PKCE flow (browser-based)
- [ ] Implement `ApiKeyProvider` (extract current behavior into trait)
- [ ] Add OS keychain integration: macOS (Security.framework), Linux (libsecret), Windows (WinCred)
- [ ] Add token refresh middleware in LLM client
- [ ] Add auth selection UI on first run (interactive menu)
- [ ] Add `/auth` slash command (login, logout, status, switch)
- [ ] Add `--auth` CLI flag to force re-authentication
- [ ] Implement rate limit display: show remaining quota in session footer
- [ ] Tests: mock OAuth server for auth flow tests, keychain read/write tests

### 7.12 Stateful Epic Workflows

**Priority: High** | **Target: v1.1**

For large feature requests that span multiple files, directories, and sessions, a structured workflow prevents the agent from losing track of progress and ensures methodical implementation.

**The `/epic` Command:**

```bash
/epic "Add Stripe billing with usage-based pricing"
```

Instead of immediate implementation, the agent:
1. Generates `.agent-code/epics/<id>/spec.md` — requirements, constraints, open questions
2. Generates `.agent-code/epics/<id>/plan.md` — sequenced checklist of implementation steps
3. Presents the plan for user review and approval
4. Implements step-by-step, checking off items as they complete

**Epic Directory Structure:**

```text
.agent-code/epics/
└── stripe-billing-2026-04-06/
    ├── spec.md          # Requirements and constraints
    ├── plan.md          # Sequenced implementation checklist
    ├── progress.json    # Machine-readable step completion status
    └── context.md       # Accumulated context from implementation
```

**Plan Format:**

```markdown
# Plan: Add Stripe Billing

## Steps

- [ ] 1. Add `stripe` crate to Cargo.toml with webhook and checkout features
- [ ] 2. Create `src/billing/mod.rs` with `BillingService` trait
- [ ] 3. Implement `StripeBillingService` with usage metering
- [x] 4. Add webhook handler for `invoice.paid` and `invoice.payment_failed`
- [ ] 5. Write integration tests with Stripe test mode
- [ ] 6. Add `/billing` CLI command for status display
```

**Worktree-Isolated Implementation (Rust Advantage):**

Each epic step executes in an isolated Git worktree via the existing `Agent` + `EnterWorktree` tools:
- Sub-agent spawns into a clean worktree branch
- Implements one plan step at a time
- Runs tests and linter in isolation
- Main agent reviews the diff via `SendMessage`
- Only merges back when tests pass — never trashes the developer's working directory

**Cross-Session Resumption:**

```bash
/epic list                    # Show all epics with progress
/epic resume stripe-billing   # Continue from last checkpoint
/epic status                  # Show current epic's remaining steps
```

Epics persist to disk. The agent reads `progress.json` on resume to pick up exactly where it left off, even across different sessions.

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] Add `/epic` slash command with subcommands: `create`, `resume`, `list`, `status`, `abandon`
- [ ] Implement spec generation: agent analyzes codebase and generates requirements document
- [ ] Implement plan generation: agent breaks spec into sequenced, testable steps
- [ ] Add `.agent-code/epics/` directory management with UUID-based epic IDs
- [ ] Add `progress.json` format: step index, status, timestamp, worktree branch, commit SHA
- [ ] Wire into `Coordinator` + `EnterWorktree`: each step spawns isolated sub-agent
- [ ] Implement diff review gate: main agent reviews sub-agent's changes before merge
- [ ] Add test verification gate: merge only if tests pass in worktree
- [ ] Cross-session resume: read progress.json, rebuild context from spec + plan + completed steps
- [ ] Add context accumulation: append key decisions and learnings to `context.md` per step
- [ ] Tests: epic creation, step execution, resume after interruption, worktree cleanup

### 7.13 Provider Prompt Caching — Done

- [x] System prompt cached with `cache_control: { type: "ephemeral" }` (`anthropic.rs:86-95`, `client.rs:189-198`)
- [x] Conversation history breakpoints via `messages_to_api_params_cached()` (`message.rs:459-504`)
- [x] Tool definitions cached with `cache_control` on last tool (`anthropic.rs:74-84`, `client.rs:176-187`) — PR #78
- [x] `Usage` struct tracks `cache_read_input_tokens` and `cache_creation_input_tokens` (`message.rs:204-230`)
- [x] SSE stream parser extracts cache token fields (`stream.rs:82-93, 318-326`)
- [x] `CacheTracker` service detects cache hits, breaks, and partial hits via fingerprinting (`cache_tracking.rs`)
- [x] `/cost` command displays cache hit percentage per model (`commands/mod.rs:402-446`)
- [x] `prompt-caching-2024-07-31` beta header enabled by default (`anthropic.rs:61-71`)
- [x] `features.prompt_caching` config toggle (default: true) to disable for unsupported providers — PR #78
- [x] System prompt rebuild uses hash-based cache to avoid unnecessary recomputation (`query/mod.rs:64`)

### 7.14 Local LLM Auto-Discovery — Partially Done

**Priority: Medium** | **Target: v1.2**

Ollama auto-detection already exists in the setup wizard (`ui/setup.rs`) — it probes `localhost:11434/api/tags` on first run when no API key is found. Remaining work: extend detection to other local servers.

**Discovery Protocol:**

On startup (if no API key found), probe default ports:

| Port | Server | Detection |
|------|--------|-----------|
| 11434 | Ollama | `GET /api/tags` → list available models |
| 1234 | LM Studio | `GET /v1/models` → OpenAI-compatible |
| 8080 | llama.cpp server | `GET /health` |
| 5000 | text-generation-webui | `GET /v1/models` |

**User Prompt:**

```text
No API key found, but a local Ollama server was detected with these models:
  1. qwen2.5-coder:32b (recommended for coding)
  2. llama3.1:70b
  3. codestral:22b

Use local model? [1/2/3/n]:
```

**Auto-Configuration:**

If user accepts, auto-populate config without requiring manual setup:

```toml
# Auto-generated — detected Ollama at localhost:11434
[api]
model = "qwen2.5-coder:32b"
base_url = "http://localhost:11434/v1"
# No API key needed for local models
```

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [x] Ollama detection in setup wizard (`ui/setup.rs`) — probes `localhost:11434/api/tags`
- [x] Interactive prompt on first run when no API key found
- [ ] Add `crates/lib/src/services/discovery.rs` — extract Ollama detection into reusable service
- [ ] Implement probe functions for LM Studio (`localhost:1234`), llama.cpp (`localhost:8080`), text-generation-webui (`localhost:5000`)
- [ ] Add model listing from each server's API
- [ ] Auto-generate config file from selected local model
- [ ] Add `--discover-local` CLI flag to manually trigger discovery
- [ ] Add timeout (500ms per port) to prevent slow startup
- [ ] Tests: mock local server responses, verify config generation

### 7.15 Conversation Branching — Partially Done

**Priority: Medium** | **Target: v1.2**

Basic forking exists via `/fork` command (`commands/mod.rs:1128`, `features.fork_conversation` config flag). It saves the current conversation with a new session ID and allows resuming with `/resume`. The remaining work is the advanced branching model: named branches, checkout to specific turns, merge, and diff.

**Commands:**

```bash
/session branch fix-attempt-2      # Create named branch from current point
/session checkout 5                # Rewind to turn 5 (keep later turns in a branch)
/session branches                  # List all branches with turn counts
/session merge fix-attempt-2       # Merge a branch's successful context back
/session diff fix-attempt-2        # Show what changed between current and branch
```

**Data Model:**

```rust
struct SessionTree {
    trunk: Vec<Message>,           // Main conversation
    branches: HashMap<String, SessionBranch>,
}

struct SessionBranch {
    name: String,
    fork_point: usize,             // Turn number where branch diverged
    messages: Vec<Message>,        // Messages after fork point
    created_at: DateTime<Utc>,
    status: BranchStatus,          // Active, Merged, Abandoned
}
```

**Branching Workflow:**

```text
Turn 1 → Turn 2 → Turn 3 → Turn 4 (failing approach)
                      │
                      └──▶ Branch "alt-approach"
                            Turn 3b → Turn 4b (working approach)
                            
/session checkout 2                    # Rewind to Turn 2
/session merge alt-approach            # Bring in Turn 3b + 4b from branch
```

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [x] `/fork` command saves current conversation and creates new session ID (`commands/mod.rs:1128`)
- [x] `/resume` command restores forked sessions
- [x] `fork_conversation` feature flag in config (default: true)
- [ ] Add `SessionTree` and `SessionBranch` structs to `services/session.rs`
- [ ] Upgrade `/fork` to support named branches (`/session branch <name>`)
- [ ] Implement `/session checkout <turn>` — rewind, auto-branch current state
- [ ] Implement `/session branches` — list with fork points and status
- [ ] Implement `/session merge <name>` — replay branch messages onto trunk
- [ ] Implement `/session diff <name>` — show tool calls and file changes between branches
- [ ] Persist branches to session JSON (backward-compatible: old sessions have no branches)
- [ ] Tests: branch creation, checkout, merge, concurrent branches

### 7.16 Proactive Security Scanning

**Priority: Medium** | **Target: v1.2**

The current permission system protects the OS from the agent. Proactive security scanning protects the *codebase* from vulnerabilities — both in dependencies and in generated code.

**Automated Dependency Auditing:**

Run security scanners automatically before commits:

```toml
[security.scanning]
enabled = true
on_commit = true         # Scan before every /commit
on_session_start = false  # Optional: scan at session start

# Auto-detect scanner based on project type
# Supported: cargo-audit, npm audit, pip-audit, osv-scanner
```

**Scanning Pipeline:**

```text
Developer runs /commit
    │
    ▼
Pre-commit hook triggers security scan
    │
    ├─ cargo audit (Rust projects)
    ├─ npm audit (Node.js projects)
    ├─ pip-audit (Python projects)
    └─ osv-scanner (universal)
    │
    ▼
If vulnerabilities found:
    │
    ├─ Low/Medium: warn and continue
    └─ High/Critical: block commit, generate remediation patch
        │
        ▼
    Agent auto-generates fix:
    ├─ Bump dependency version
    ├─ Apply security patch
    └─ Add vulnerability comment explaining risk
```

**Code Pattern Scanning:**

Beyond dependencies, scan generated code for common vulnerability patterns:

| Pattern | Detection | Auto-Fix |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| SQL injection | Raw string interpolation in queries | Parameterized query |
| Command injection | User input in shell commands | Escape/allowlist |
| Hardcoded secrets | Regex patterns for API keys, passwords | Environment variable |
| Path traversal | Unsanitized file paths | Canonicalization |
| Insecure deserialization | `pickle.loads`, `eval()` | Safe alternatives |

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] Add `[security.scanning]` config section

### 7.17 Hierarchical Context Resolution

**Priority: Medium** | **Target: v1.2**

Currently, project context is loaded from a single root-level file. For monorepos and deep directory structures, context should be merged hierarchically based on the agent's current working focus.

**Resolution Order:**

When working on `frontend/components/Button.tsx`, load and merge:

```text
.agent-code/CONTEXT.md          ← Global rules (code style, architecture)
frontend/.agent-code/CONTEXT.md  ← Frontend-specific (React patterns, component conventions)
frontend/components/.agent-code/CONTEXT.md  ← Component-specific (if exists)
```

**Merge Strategy:**

- Later (more specific) files override earlier (more general) ones
- Sections are merged by heading — a frontend CONTEXT.md can override the "Code Style" section without affecting "Architecture"
- Array values (e.g., "tools to use") are concatenated, not replaced

**Auto-Detection:**

The agent determines working focus from:
1. Files recently read or edited (last 3 turns)
2. Current `/cd` directory
3. Explicit `@` file references in the prompt

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] Modify context loader in `services/` to traverse directory tree upward
- [ ] Implement section-based merge strategy (by markdown heading)
- [ ] Add working focus detection from recent file operations
- [ ] Cache resolved context per directory (invalidate on file change)
- [ ] Add `/context` slash command showing resolved context with source annotations
- [ ] Tests: multi-level merge, section override, array concatenation

### 7.18 Shell Passthrough Context Injection

**Priority: Medium** | **Target: v1.2**

The `!` prefix already exists in the REPL (`crates/cli/src/ui/repl.rs:603`) and runs shell commands directly. However, the current implementation has two limitations:

1. **No context injection** — output is printed but NOT appended to conversation history, so the agent can't reference it in subsequent turns
2. **No real-time streaming** — uses `.output()` (captures after completion) instead of `Stdio::inherit()`, so long-running commands show no output until they finish

**Upgraded Behavior:**

```text
> ! cargo test
running 45 tests                    ← streams in real-time
test auth::test_login ... ok
test billing::test_charge ... FAILED

45 tests, 1 failure

> The billing test is failing — can you see why?
(Agent now has the test output in context without needing to run Bash tool)
```

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] Switch from `.output()` to `Stdio::inherit()` or `tee`-like approach for real-time streaming
- [ ] Capture stdout+stderr into buffer while displaying in real-time
- [ ] Append captured output as system message to conversation history: `[Shell output from: cargo test]\n<output>`
- [ ] Add output truncation at 50KB with "[truncated]" marker
- [ ] Do NOT count as a turn or consume LLM tokens
- [ ] Tests: verify real-time streaming, verify context injection, verify truncation

### 7.19 Voice Mode

- [ ] STT integration for voice input
- [ ] TTS integration for spoken responses
- [ ] Push-to-talk keybinding

### 7.20 Scheduled Agents

- [ ] Cron-based agent execution (`agent cron add "0 9 * * *" --prompt "run tests"`)
- [ ] Remote trigger via webhook (`agent trigger --listen :8080`)
- [ ] Background daemon for scheduled runs

### 7.21 Web and Desktop Clients

- [ ] Headless API server mode (`agent serve`) as the foundation
- [ ] Web client connecting via HTTP + SSE
- [ ] Desktop client via Flutter (cross-platform: macOS, Windows, Linux, with future iOS/Android path)
- [ ] Use JSON-RPC over WebSocket for bidirectional IPC between Flutter client and agent-code backend (per prior architectural decision: HTTP+SSE fails at bidirectional permission prompting; stdio fails at reconnection)
- [ ] All clients share the same backend

## Performance Targets — In Progress

| Metric | Before | After | Target (v1.0) | Status |
|--------|--------|-------|---------------|--------|
| Startup time | ~200ms (blocked by sync curl) | <150ms (async key check) | <150ms | **Done** |
| Tool dispatch overhead | unmeasured | unmeasured | <1ms per tool call | Planned |
| Binary size (release) | ~15MB | est. <12MB (codegen-units=1, panic=abort, narrowed tokio) | <12MB | **Done** |
| Context compaction latency | unmeasured | benchmarked | <500ms for microcompact | **Done** |
| Tests | 232+ | 400+ | 400+ | **Done** |
| Test coverage | Codecov active | Codecov active | >70% | In Progress |
| Supported platforms | 6 (Linux, macOS, Windows, Docker, npm) | 6 | 7 (+ homebrew-core) | Planned |

### Changes Made

- **Startup**: Moved blocking `curl` API key validation (5s timeout) to async background task with 500ms non-blocking window
- **Binary size**: Added `codegen-units = 1` and `panic = "abort"` to release profile; narrowed tokio features from `"full"` to specific needed features
- **Tests**: Added 170+ new unit and integration tests across error types, config schema, memory types, LLM providers, permissions, message normalization, retry logic, token estimation, compaction, pricing, and bash parsing
- **Benchmarks**: Added startup benchmark (config loading) alongside existing compaction and token estimation benchmarks
