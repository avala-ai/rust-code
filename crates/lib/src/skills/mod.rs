//! Skill system.
//!
//! Skills are reusable, user-defined workflows loaded from markdown
//! files in `.agent/skills/` or `~/.config/agent-code/skills/`. Each
//! skill is a markdown file with YAML frontmatter that defines:
//!
//! - `description`: what the skill does
//! - `whenToUse`: when to invoke it
//! - `userInvocable`: whether users can invoke it via `/skill-name`
//!
//! The body of the skill file is a prompt template that gets expanded
//! when the skill is invoked. Supports `{{arg}}` substitution.

                 any sanitizer to the dangerous sink. If a sanitizer exists, explain why \
                 it is or is not sufficient for this specific sink. Produce hypothesized \

                 proof-of-concept: a curl command, an exact payload string, or \
                 reproduction steps. If no PoC is producible from code inspection alone, \

                 impact, and PoC. End with a summary table and a ship-readiness verdict. \

                 sequence of steps that worked, stripped of session-specific details \
                 (filenames, variable names, error text).\n\

                 collide with an existing skill.\n\

                 `userInvocable: true`. The body is the prompt — imperative instructions \

                 happened this session.\n\

                 (\"don't touch file X\", \"always run tests before push\") as explicit \
                 rules in the prompt.\n\

                 (textually-local rename, trivial import reorder). If the resolution \

                 `backport/<source-sha-or-pr>-onto-<target>` and open a PR with a body \
                 that links back to the original PR and notes any resolution you made.\n   \

                 failure in the summary.\n\

                 Never force-push. Never squash-merge the backport without the \
